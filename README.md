# Boston House Prices

This notebook demonstrates my ML modeling efforts for predicting house prices in Boston using several feature. I am personally interested in real-state value forecasting and am really excited to work on this topic, as I hope to be able to better understand some of the challenges involved in this task.

Since the goal is to predict a continuous value (median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s), I am going to use a regression algorithm for my modeling purpose. As the first step, I plan to use a very simple regression model, linear regression, and see what is going to be the accuracy of this model. I may try more complicated regression models too, if I observe a large error via linear regression.

There are 13 input features in this dataset, including: crime rate, average number of rooms per house, index of accessability, property tax-rate, percentage of lower status of the population, and more. Most of these features are floating point, and there are two which are integer.
